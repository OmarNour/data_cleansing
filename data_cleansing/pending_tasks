daily draft:
BT is loaded with data and add new 190k from source: 0:13:15.627507
try with new BT 11 and add 190K from source: 0:05:15.472044
test with 20k records only with same current BT 10
add index to df
try load all data once from source 190k to new BT:
try load all data once from source 190k to loaded BT: 0:07:43.537513, 0:12:34.739169,
search how to release memory back before running
